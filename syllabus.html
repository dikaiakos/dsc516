        <h4>Teaching and Learning Methods</h4>
        <article>
            <p> Students will meet the expected learning outcomes through participation to lectures,
                active participation to class discussions, reviewing precept videos, quizzes, and lab sessions, reading and writing assignments, and actual
                practice.  The course is given in <strong>hybrid mode</strong>: lectures are delivered synchronously in class;  precepts and some labs
                will be delivered online and asynchronously. In particular, course-work comprises:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 hours of weekly lectures (delivered in class)</strong>, where the main concepts and methodologies covered
                    by the course are presented and critically appraised. Students are required to review and study the
                    materials assigned for each lecture, as defined in the <a href="schedule.html" target="_blank ">Course
                        Outline</a>, and actively participate in class.
                </li>
            <li><strong>1 hour of weekly precept</strong>, wherein we administer an online course on <strong>AWS Academy Cloud  Foundations</strong>
                    prepared and delivered by the Amazon Web Services Academy. This course comprises videos, notes, and
                    quizzes designed to help students prepare for <strong>AWS Accreditation</strong>.
                    The link to the course is posted on the course's <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Resources</a> web page and
                    <a href="schedule.html" target="_blank ">Schedule</a> web page.
                </li>
            <li><strong>1.5 hours of laboratory work</strong>, delivered as announced, either in person at the lab or asynchronously online. A large part of the labs entails practice
                    with AWS services, following the hands-on  AWS Academy's online course <strong>AWS Cloud Developing</strong>.
                    The course comprises videos, notes, hands-on exercises, and quizzes designed to help students prepare for <strong>AWS Accreditation</strong>
                    The link to the course is posted on the course's <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Resources</a> web page and
                    <a href="schedule.html" target="_blank ">Schedule</a> web page.
                </li>
                <li>Reading and programming assignments.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <h4>Attendance Rules</h4>
        <article>Students are expected to <strong>actively participate in Lectures, Precepts and Labs</strong>,
            where the main concepts and methodologies covered by the course are presented and critically appraised.
            Classroom attendance is <strong>obligatory.</strong> The following rules apply and will be implemented:
            <ol>
                <li>Attendance will be taken at the beginning of class. Be on time!</li>
                <li>Eligibility to participate in the final examination requires attendance of more than 50% of the scheduled lectures.
                    <span style="color: red;"><strong>Absence from over 50% of the lectures will result in automatic failure of the course.</strong></span></li>
                <li>More  than 3  inexcusable absences from the weekly lectures will reduce your class
                    participation mark to 0.</li>
                <li>Unavoidable absences due to illness or family emergencies will be excused, provided that the instructor is notified in advance.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Class Participation Rules</h4>
        Please observe and apply the following rules when attending classes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The use of laptops, mobile devices, and tablets during lectures is prohibited</strong>, unless explicitly requested by the professor.</li>
                <li>Display a name-card in front of you.</li>
                <li>Come prepared to class: do the readings and be ready to discuss them (there may be cold-calling) – just showing up is not enough to get full marks for
                attendance</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <h4>Evaluation and Grading</h4>
        Student progress is evaluated <strong>continuously</strong> through class participation and the assessment of
       assignments, midterm, and final exam. Students are required to study the materials for each lecture, as announced on
        <a href="https://blackboard.ucy.ac.cy/ultra/courses/_14590_1/outline" target="_new">Blackboard</a>,
        with additional readings, videos and materials for each topic given in the <a href="topics.html"  target="_blank ">Course Topics</a> page.
        The final grade is  based on  the following formula:
        <dl class="dl-horizontal" style="border: solid 1px; background-color: #FFFFF9">
            <dt>Class Participation:</dt>
            <dd>5%</dd>
            <dt>Projects and Homeworks:</dt>
            <dd>10%</dd>
            <dt>Midterm Exam:</dt>
            <dd>30%</dd>
            <dt>Final Exam:</dt>
            <dd>55% (attendance to final exam will not be allowed if you have over 50% absences from course lectures).</dd>
        </dl>

        <h4>ECTS Analysis</h4>
        <article>
            One ECTS unit corresponds to <strong>25-30 hours of work undertaken by an average student</strong> to
            complete successfully expected learning outcomes. Consequently, the successful completion of the class
            requires a total of <strong>187.5-225 hours of work</strong>, on average. The workload of the average
            student is analysed as follows:
            <ol list-style-type="none">
                <li><strong>Class, Precept, and Lab participation:</strong> 5,5 hours per week for 13 weeks, totalling to 71  hours.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Study at home:</strong> 5 hours per week for 13 weeks, totalling 65 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Group project:</strong> 90 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Group project Final Report and Presentation:</strong> 7 hours</li>
            </ol>
            Consequently, the total workload for successfully completing this course, is estimated to 240 hours on average.

        <h4>Use of Generative AI Tools</h4>
            <article>
               The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undergoing rapid developments. Generative Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT/ChatPDF, allow the generation of written text, audio and images with highly realistic results.
                The University of Cyprus (UCY) is committed in the ethical and responsible use of AI based on specific principles for its utilization and on the appropriate preparedness of its staff and students.
                The following principles/recommendations regarding the utilization of AI in the educational process are in effect, starting in the Fall Semester 2023-2024, and will be revised at regular time intervals.

                <h5>GENERAL CONTEXT OF USE</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>UCY encourages experimentation with available AI tools that aid the process of comprehension and learning, given that their use does not violate applicable ethical principles. It is noted that, AI tools must be utilised in combination with critical thinking, while also acknowledging their sometimes potentially serious weaknesses. Implementation of such practices, can potentially lead to the constructive enhancement of the teaching and learning process.</li>
                    <li>Instructors may allow students to use AI tools in coursework assignments for the purpose of searching and cross-referencing information, to the extent that such use contributes to the achievement of the learning objectives.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>TRANSPARENCY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>When AI tools are used in coursework assignments, students must explicitly and accurately declare any AI tools used and how these were utilized in the process.</li>
                    <li>It is noted that the use of AI tools by students can contribute to the cultivation of critical thinking skills, through the evaluation of the quality of the assistance/responses
                        generated by the AI tool(s).</li>
                    <li>Specific instructions for the use of AI by students may be provided by the instructors as part of the course syllabus or as part of the written
                        guidelines of a coursework assignment/examination, based on the unique characteristics of a course.</li>
                    <li>Instructors are encouraged to adapt the assessment methods for coursework assignments/examinations in order to ensure the integrity of the assessment process
                        (e.g., take-home exams and thesis assessments may be supplemented by an oral examination).</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>ETHICAL USE AND ACCOUNTABILITY</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verbatim copying from text generated by AI tools is prohibited. Instructors have the option of using plagiarism detection tools that
                        recognize AI-generated text.  It is noted, however, that plagiarism detection tools may have a margin of error. In the
                        event of plagiarism, further disciplinary action may be taken in accordance with the
                        <a href="https://applications.ucy.ac.cy/icons/ects/docs/General_rules_of_study.pdf" target="_blank"> Undergraduate Studies Rules (pages 35-43)</a > for undergraduate students and with the

                        for postgraduate students (Additional information on how students can recognize and avoid plagiarism in general, are provided in the electronic booklet guide of the University of Cyprus Library entitled "ACADEMIC PLAGIARISM: How to identify and avoid it”.)</li>
                    <li>It is noted that AI tools should be utilized with great caution, with regards to the data submitted to them as input (personal or confidential data, copyrighted information, etc.) and to the results that arise from their use. It is also important to consider that, currently popular AI tools generate algorithmically-derived responses based on existing text which is available online, without confirmation of the accuracy and timeliness of these responses in comparison to valid scientific information sources.</li>
                    <li>Users of AI tools are solely responsible for confirming the accuracy of data and ensuring unbiased and ethical conduct.</li>
                </ul>
